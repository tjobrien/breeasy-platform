<blockquote>"I designed and built the Breeasy small business management and billing, time-tracking apps because as a small business owner and technology consultant, I couldn't find anything that met my needs.  So, I built them myself.  Foremost, they needed to have a ton of features, be simple and easy to use, a strong community, and provide real value to its users both in utility and price. Now, I use them everyday."<br>
- Tom 0., Founder, Breeasy.com - On why he created the <a href="http://www.breeasy.com/apps/">inexpensive and simple business apps</a>.
